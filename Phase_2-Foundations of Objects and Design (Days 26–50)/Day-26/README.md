# Day 26 — Python Object Model



Today focuses on understanding how Python works internally.



Key areas explored:

* Everything in Python is an object
* Variables as references, not containers
* Identity, type, and value
* Mutability vs immutability



This mental model is essential before learning classes and OOP design.
