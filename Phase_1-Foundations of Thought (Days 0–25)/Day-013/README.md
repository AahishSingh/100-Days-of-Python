# Day 13 — List Slicing \& Copying



Today I learned how to extract parts of a list using slicing
and how to correctly copy lists without causing bugs.



Topics covered:

* List slicing
* start:end:step syntax
* Negative slicing
* List copying vs referencing



This day focuses on understanding how lists behave in memory.
