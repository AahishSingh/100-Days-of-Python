# Day 14 — Tuples (Immutable Sequences)



Today I learned about tuples and why immutability is an
important concept in Python.



Topics covered:

* Creating tuples
* Tuple indexing and slicing
* Immutability
* Tuple vs list
* When to use tuples



Tuples help protect data from unintended modification.
