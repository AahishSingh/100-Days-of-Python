# Phase 1 — Foundations of Thought (Days 0–25)



This phase marks the **foundation** of my *100 Days of Python* journey.

Phase 1 was not about rushing syntax or finishing Python quickly.  
It was about **building the correct way of thinking**, understanding how Python works internally, and developing clean programming habits.



---

## 🎯 Phase Objective



By the end of Phase 1, I aimed to:

* Build strong fundamentals in Python
* Understand core programming concepts deeply
* Write clean, readable, and safe code
* Develop confidence before moving into advanced topics

## 📅 Phase Duration



* **Day 0 → Day 25**
* Total Days: **26**
* Focus: **Foundations, clarity, and discipline**
