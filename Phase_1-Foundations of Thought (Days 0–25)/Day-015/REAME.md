# Day 15 — Sets (Unique Collections)



Today I learned how Python uses sets to store unique,
unordered data and perform set operations.



Topics covered:

* Creating sets
* Uniqueness and unordered nature
* Adding and removing elements
* Set operations (union, intersection, difference)



Sets are useful when uniqueness matters.
