# Day 79 — Mocking & Isolation

Today focuses on:
- Understanding why mocks exist
- Isolating units from external dependencies
- Using unittest.mock to control behavior
- Writing tests that are fast and deterministic

This day teaches how to test your code
without relying on the real world.
