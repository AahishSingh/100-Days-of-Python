# Day 84 — Error Handling as Design

Today focuses on:
- Understanding exceptions as design tools
- Differentiating errors from normal control flow
- Writing meaningful exception handling
- Avoiding silent or misleading failures

This day reframes errors
as part of system behavior, not mistakes.
