# Day 89 — Installing Your Own Package (Editable Installs)

Today focuses on:
- Installing a local Python package
- Understanding editable installs (`pip install -e .`)
- Making imports work the professional way
- Connecting project structure to runtime behavior

This day turns structure
into something Python can actually use.
